The advanced capabilities, high speed, increased bandwidth and low latency of 5G will help inspire development of a wide variety of new use cases that include everything from massive numbers of IoT devices that use very few network resources, to smartphones with nearly infinite opportunities to use data, to more complex solutions such as AR/VR and mixed reality that will require massive computing capabilities on the edge of the network. 


## IoT
5G was designed specifically to support the types of massive senor grids and industrial IoT (IIOT) applications we are currently witnessing the emergence of. 
Cutting-edge manufacturing sites, distribution centers and numerous other campus environments can benefit from the deployment of a private 5G infrastructure supporting either 4G or 5G radio access networks.
